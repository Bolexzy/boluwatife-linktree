# Personal Link Tree

This is a personal link tree project built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), a powerful React framework. It's a simple and elegant solution to share all your important links (like your portfolio, social media profiles, blogs, etc.) with others using a single link.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```

2. Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

3. Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Features
This project uses next/font to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font. This ensures that your website has a consistent typography across different browsers and devices.
